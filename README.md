# Microservices-Deployment
This repository contains a sample application that has multiple microservices that I've Dockerized and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.



### Credits

Special thanks to **Deekshith** for contributing to this project. **Deekshith** wrote the Code for the microservices and creating Application Architecture Design. 
Thank you for your hard work and dedication to this project.


## Application Architecture

#### In the UI, as the user clicks on a specific button, specific data is sent to API-Gateway, and depending on that, it will validate the request and redirect to a specific microservice (respective API).
#### The application consists of 6 different Microservices. Architecture of sample multiple microservices developed in different technologies - Spring Boot, Node.js, Python, React.js in a project. Microservices connected by an API Gateway using Netflix Zuul. 





##### Frontend - UI
-   [ui-web-app-reactjs](https://github.com/sarat9/microservices-architect-config-starter/tree/main/ui-web-app-reactjs)  - Single Page Application that provides the UI
#####  APIGateway -  Zuul 
-   [zuul-api-gateway](https://github.com/sarat9/microservices-architect-config-starter/tree/main/zuul-api-gateway)  - API gateway that proxies all the micro-services

##### Backend Services - Cart, Offers, Shoes, Wishlist 
-   [cart-microservice-nodejs](https://github.com/sarat9/microservices-architect-config-starter/tree/main/cart-microservice-nodejs)  - Node.js App with Cart data
-   [offers-microservice-spring-boot](https://github.com/sarat9/microservices-architect-config-starter/tree/main/offers-microservice-spring-boot)  - Spring Boot App with Offers data
-   [shoes-microservice-spring-boot](https://github.com/sarat9/microservices-architect-config-starter/tree/main/shoes-microservice-spring-boot)  - Spring Boot App with Shoe data
-   [wishlist-microservice-python](https://github.com/sarat9/microservices-architect-config-starter/tree/main/wishlist-microservice-python)  - Python App with Wishlist data
